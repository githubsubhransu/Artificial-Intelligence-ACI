    "To apply the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) model to the Catch-Up with Numbers game, we first need to define each component of the PEAS model and then explore the specific data structures and fringes used to implement the agent and its interactions within the game environment.\n",

    "### PEAS Model for Catch-Up with Numbers Game\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Measure (P):\n",
    "- **Goal**: Maximize the numeric sum while adhering to the game's rules.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Minimize the number of turns taken to reach a conclusion.\n",
    "- **Fair Play**: Adhere strictly to the turn-taking and number-choosing rules outlined in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment (E):\n",
    "- **Type**: Discrete, deterministic, and fully observable.\n",
    "- **Composition**: The set of available numbers: \\(1, 2, 3, ... n\\).\n",
    "- **Dynamics**: Static during a player’s turn (the environment doesn’t change unless a player acts).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actuators (A):\n",
    "- **Choosing Numbers**: The agent's actions include selecting one or more numbers from the set, which influences the state of the game environment.\n",

    "- **Number Availability**: The agent senses or perceives which numbers are still available to be chosen after each turn.\n"
